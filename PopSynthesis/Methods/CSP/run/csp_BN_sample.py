"""Using BN to sample should quick for each step, but the conditional need to think abit"""

# need the possible states for each atts, also including the min and max for each count (n_rela)
# process the given dict of conditionals (seed matching with count) to do the fitting for BN
# dertermine the n_rela for each hh using BN (merge later), need conditional sampling and then merge
